# The Avicii project: visualising the sentiment of music lyrics in Python

You can use this project to analyse music lyrics (text) for sentiment using Google Natural Language API.
It also allows you to visualise the results in a unique way.
I personally use the visuals to make my own personal music t-shirts.
Here's an example of me being happy with my very own dataviz t-shirt.

 [Read the origin story](http://www.edriessen.com/projects/the-avicii-project/) to find out why I created this project.

# Create a dataviz of the lyrics of your favourite artist

Good to see that you want to give my repository a try. The process is split into two parts:

1. Analyse the song texts.
2. Visualise the sentiment data.

I'll use Avicii's posthumous album TIM as an example in this readme. 
You can see an example setup in `run-example.py`. 
Let's dig in.

# 1. Analyse the songtexts

To run an analysis, you'll need a connection to the Google Cloud Natural Language API. 
Set up a project in the Google Cloud console and add your `credentials.json` to the project root folder. 
After that, you'll need a `.txt` file for each song that you want to analyse. 
I use https://www.azlyrics.com to get my lyrics.

Format each `.txt` file like this: `song index-album name-song title.txt`. 

For the song Peace of Mind by Avicii, the first song on the album TIM, this would be: `1-tim-peace of mind.txt`. 
Store the text files of an albums inside the `songs` folder in my project. 

When you have the files ready, you can use `analyse_files_and_store_in_csv` from `analyse.py` to run the sentiment analysis and store the results in a csv file. 
The function takes two arguments:

- path to song files, e.g. `songs/avicii tim`.
- name of the csv file that will be stored in the output folder, e.g. `avicii tim`. 

A full example looks like this:

`analyse_files_and_store_in_csv('songs/avicii tim', 'avicii tim')`

### Scrape lyrics automatically from Genius.com
You have the option to scrape for the lyrics using the `lyrics.py` file. 
To use the script, you have to generate an access key on https://genius.com/api-clients.
Store the access key in a json file called `credentials-genius.json` with this format:

```
{
  "access-key": "your access key here"
}
```

After that, enter the song titles, artist, and album as appropriate in `lyrics.py`. 
You will need to create the appropriate folder under the songs folder (for example, for Lady Gaga, you will need to create a `Lady Gaga` folder: `songs/Lady Gaga`. 
The script will generate the text files and put them in the folder.

_Small changes in the lyrics can impact the visual.
So be sure to check the lyrics when you get them automatically._

# 2. Visualise the sentiment data

You can visualise the data with the functions in `visualise.py` . 
There are two types of visualisations:

2.1 Scatter plot - `scatter_plot_from_dataframe`
2.2 Line plot - `plot_path_from_dataframe`
2.3 Edge Path

You'll have to transform the generated sheet into a dataframe first. 
You can do so using the standard Pandas `read_csv` function:

```
tim_df = pd.read_csv('output/avicii tim.csv').sort_values(by='index').reset_index()
```

## 2.1 The scatterplot of your favourite music

Use the `scatter_plot_from_dataframe` function to create a scatter plot. 
It gives you an readable overview of the sentiment analysis' results. 
You only have to pass 1 value (a dataframe):

```
scatter_plot_from_dataframe(
    dataframe=tim_df,
)
```
Here's an example of the results:

![Avicii Time Scatter Basic](sample_dataviz/avicii_scatter_basic.png)

The function has some optional extra values you can use:

```
scatter_plot_from_dataframe(
    dataframe=tim_df,
    magnitude_amplifier=0,
    album_color='purple',
    annotate='index',
    disable_grid=True,
)
```
Some details on the values:

- dataframe: the data frame you want to visualise.
- magnitude_amplifier: changes the size of a dot based on the magnitude.
- album_color: the color for the dots. Leave empty for sentiment colours red, grey, and green. 
- annotate: define how you'd like to annotate the dots. Use `'title'`, `'index'`, or `'index title'`. Leave empty for no annotation.
- disable_grid: do you want to hide the grid of the plot (`True`/`False`)?

Here's another example of the resulting dataviz from this function:

## 2.2 The line path of your favourite music

This one feels magical to me. 
Using the patches option from Matplotlib, you can draw an organic looking line (generated by Bézier curves). 
It's drawn from one song to the next based on the index on the album.  
Use the `path_plot_from_dataframe` function to create the line. 
Again, you only have to pass a dataframe.

```
plot_path_from_dataframe(
    dataframe=df
)
```

And the result is: 

![Avicii Time Path Basic](sample_dataviz/avicii_path_basic.png)

Wow, that is some nice abstract dataviz right?! :)

Also this function has some extra options. 
I've used these during testing to see if lines were drawn correctly. 
I decided to keep them in so you can get an understanding of how the drawing works. 
Here's an example of the function with all it's extra options set:

```
plot_path_from_dataframe(
    dataframe=df,
    show_dots=True,
    disable_grids=False,
    line_type='straight',
    line_color='black',
    emo_grid=False
)

```
Some details on the values:

- dataframe: the data frame you want to visualise.
- show_dots: do you want to show dots in this plot (`True`/`False`)?
- disable_grids: do you want to hide the grid of the plot (`True`/`False`)?
- line_type: the type of line you want to use. Use `'s'` or `'straight'` for a straight line. Default is curved (Bézier curves).
- line_color: set the colour for the line. Use supported default color label or hex colour, e.g. `'#ff0000'`. 
- emo_grid: plots the following four quadrants in the image: weak negative, strong negative, weak positive, strong positive. 

And again the result:

# 2.3 Custom Edge Paths

I have included an option to draw a different kind of path. 
As discussed, the path is normally drawn based on the order of the songs on an album. 
But if you want, you can change it to an edge shape. 
This draws a line across the outermost points in the data set. 

Here's an example of the data of Avicii's TIM: 

![Avicii Edge Path Straight](sample_dataviz/avicii_edge_path_straight.png)

And the version with a curved path:

![Avicii Edge Path Curved](sample_dataviz/avicii_edge_path_curved.png)

Technically, it works like this:

- The script finds the data point with lowest score in the dataframe. 
If there are multiple, it selects the one with the highest magnitude.
- Next, it goes looking for the next data point with a higher score and higher magnitude. 
If there aren't any, it picks the nearest point with a higher score.
- After that, it keeps on looking for data points with a higher score and a max difference of 1.1 in magnitude. 
Again, if there aren't any matches, it picks the nearest point with a higher score.
- When there are no values with a higher scores left, it flips it search. Looking for lower scores and lower magnitudes.
This last check picks up all the remaining data points for the path.

When the edge path order is defined, it adds a copy of the first row of the dataframe as the last row. 
This closes the path into a full loop.

To use this edge path option, you have to filter the data frame. 
You can pass a `start_at` parameter, to have the path start at a point of choosing. 

```python
from custom_path import sort_df_by_starting_point

df = pd.read_csv('output/avicii tim.csv').sort_values(by='index')

df_filtered = sort_df_by_starting_point(
  df=df,
  start_at='bad-reputation'
)
```

I've used this edge path to make myself a Gorillaz album t-shirt. Read the story here: [Gorillaz T-Shirt Story](http://www.edriessen.com/2020/11/28/gorillaz-gorillaz-and-a-new-dataviz-t-shirt/).
